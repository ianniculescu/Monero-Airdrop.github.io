	 What is Monero ?
 </h2>
 <p class ="article">
	 Monero is a very special cryptocurrencie, that is private, and gives you the ability to send value everywhere in the world almost instantly for less than a cent in Monero. To use it you just have to download a wallet and save the 24 words mnemonic seed. This key gives you control of your coins and proves it is your property.
 </p>
 <h2 class = title>
  You need Monero trust me bro.
 </h2>
 <p class ="article">Monero is the best form of money Humanity has ever invented. In our current system banks have the ability to create money from nothing and buy your labour. They give you paper that you believe is valuable.
The amount of fake paper is growing every year in our economy. And your savings are getting less valuable. My grandparents lost all their savings in Romania due to inflation, in fact until this day people in romania talk in millions to denominate the value of 100 RON bills.</p>
 <p class ="article">In fact the closer you are to the bank, the cheaper you can get this monopoly money and buy property to enrich yourself. House prices get more and more expensive leaving you dreaming of owning a house one day but you don’t have this power of printing money that they have.</p>
 <p class ="article"><i>“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered”.</i><br>-Thomas Jefferson</p>
 <p class ="article">You may think that you’re getting the short end of the stick. But you are actually priviledged because you have access to banking services and you can still get a relatively cheap loan.
 This is not the case for billions of people that have access to poor or no banking services. These are people working hard for a small wage just to survive often doing dangerous jobs in countries that have poor social security or health care. And they are the prey of Institutions that give them loans and trap them into debt.</p>
 <p class ="article"><i>“Gold is money. Everything else is credit.”</i><br>-J.P. Morgan</p>
 <p class ="article">We need neutral money that can’t be printed “Monero”, that is secure.<br>This money needs to have small transaction fees, below 1 cent would be ideal “Monero”, This Money needs to be <b><u>PRIVATE</u></b>. “Monero”.<br></p>
 <h2 class = title>
  Privacy is a human right !
 </h2>
 <p class="article">Monero is special because it is the most used private cryptocurrencie. Bitcoin transactions are public on the blockchain. if you can connect an identity to an address, you will know the entire financial history of that person.</p>
 <p class ="article"><a class = "link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4oOrMejI3k&t=22s&ab_channel=aantonop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy is a human right</a> recognized in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights and in many other international and regional treaties, it is also the fountainhead for all the other human rights. If you don’t have privacy you don’t have freedom of expression, you don’t have freedom of association.
 According to Rummel After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimated that there have been <a class = "link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">262 million victims</a> of democide in the last century.</p>
 <p class ="article">
	 Population in 1900 : 1.6 B<br>Population in 2000 : 6.1 B
 </p>
 <p class ="article">Depending on how you count, the number can be much higher. This is the equivalent of counting the number of death in a <a class = "link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&t=265s&ab_channel=NeilHalloran" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuclear blast.</a> People that are caught directly in the center of the blast represent a minority of the number of death caused by collateral damage further away from the center.</p>
 <p class ="article">For example sex ratio difference is the ratio between male and female. In some countries this ratio is highly skewed, The evidence for sex-selective abortion and discrimination against girls is now strong across several countries. It is estimated at more than <a class = "link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#how-many-women-are-missing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 million missing girls.</a> We see that more than 80% are missing from China and India. Part of this number is the cause of Government policy.</p>
 <p class ="article">One of the biggest threat for humanity that will cause massive suffering is authoritarianism. The control that Government have over people is increasing, the walls and bars of technology that will trap innocent souls will become too difficult to escape. We are moving towards centralization of power where “you will own nothing and be happy”. Democracies are not the norm if we look at history and they tend to collapse in very bad ways.</p>
 <p class ="article">Privacy is the way we protect people. Financial privacy is how we protect their property, making violence less profitable and thus disincentivizing it.</p>
 <p class ="article">Our current system still allows terrorism financing, money laundering. And banks are fined millions of dollars every year for it, for the tip of the iceberg that is discovered. Do people often go to jail for it?</p>
 <p class ="article">And it allows our most powerful politicians to keep their financial data private. Normal citizens should have this power first.</p>
